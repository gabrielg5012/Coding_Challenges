"""
A thief has managed to find out the four digits for an online PIN code, but doesnâ€™t know the correct sequence 
needed to hack into the account.
Design and write a program that displays all the possible combinations for any four numerical digits entered by the
user. The program should avoid displaying the same
combination more than once.
Submit a fully detailed Showcase for your program.
